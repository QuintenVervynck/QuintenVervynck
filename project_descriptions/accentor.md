### Description
A fully working desktop-application for a music library (playing songs, placing them in a queue, sorting tracks, searching tracks, …)
### Gained skills
This application was written in Java (with JavaFX) and queried a REST API. It was implemented using an object-oriented style, combined with Model View Controller (a style of reactive programming).
