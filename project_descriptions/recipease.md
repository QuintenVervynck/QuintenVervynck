# RecipEase
### Description
The assignment of this project was "create an app". We were given (total) freedom, and had to invent and develop an app. This was done with a group of 4 people. We choose to create an app for people that live and eat toghether. You can create a group like your household or your dorm, and then you get a calendar for that group on which you can plan you meals. meals (dishes) are also a part of the app. You can search them online with an API and save them, or you can add your own creations. once all the planning is done you can generate a shopping list (and add products you also need but aren't in the dishes, like pudding or toiletpaper). Furthermore you also get a feed of what you're going to eat in the upcomming days. 
### Gained kills
learned how to werk with a bigger team of developpers than just 2 persons. We also had to learn the android framework and Kotlin.
