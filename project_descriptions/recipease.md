# RecipEase
### Description
The assignment of this project was "create an app". We were given (total) freedom, and had to invent and create an app. This was done with a group of 4 people. We choose to create an app for people that live toghether and eat toghether. You can create a group like your household or your dorm, and then you get a calendar for that group on which you can plan you meals. meals (dishes) are also a part of the app. You can search them online with an API and save them, or add your own creations. once all the planning is done you can generate a shopping list (and add products you also need but aren't in the dishes, like pudding or toiletpaper). Furthermore you also get a feed of what you're going to eat in the upcomming days. 
### Gained kills
learned how to werk with a bigger team of developperls than 2. We also had to learn the android framework and Kotlin.
