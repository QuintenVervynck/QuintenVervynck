[Now](#to-be-continued)

---

### _2019_
- graduated secondary / high school in `mathematics & science`
- started at Ghent University `Computer Science`
- Discrete Mathematics & mathematical logics
- First steps into the world of Programming, in Java
- Linux systems & bash scripting
- `Databases`

---

### _2020_
- Calculus & Linear Algebra
- Algorithms and Datastructures I
- `Object Ori√´nted Programming`: this course taught the object-ori√´nted programming style, in Java
  - In this course we had to make a music application named [Accentor](project_descriptions/accentor.md)
- `Scripting Languages`: this course taught me Python and Javascript
- _started the second year of my bachelor degree_
- Statistics and Probability: in this course we learned the language R
- System Programming: a course about C and C++
  - in this course we made a 3D version of the video game Supaplex, it was called [Sysplex](project_descriptions/sysplex.md) 
- `Communication Networks`: a course about networking
- `Functional Programming`: this course taught the functional programming style in Haskell
- Algorithms and Datastructures II
  - In this course we made an AI for a 3D version of the game Yavalath, it was called [Yavalath++](project_descriptions/yavalath.md)

---

### _2021_
- Scientific Mathematics (numerical mathematics)
- Computer Architecture: about the architecture of a computer (things like how does a cpu work, how does ram-memory work,...)
- Multimedia: about imaging, video and sound and of course the compression / storage / display of them
- `Webdevelopment`: taught the fundamentals of the web (`REST` & `API's`), the goals (like rdf, and control of you own data)
  - but also frameworks like Express React and Vue
- Software Engineering Lab I: taught us Kotlin and android development
  - we made an entire app called [RecipEase](project_descriptions/recipease.md)
