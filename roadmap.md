##

### _2021_
- Scientific Mathematics (numerical mathematics)
- Computer Architecture: about the architecture of a computer (things like how does a cpu work, how does ram-memory work,...)
- Multimedia: about imaging, video and sound and of course the compression / storage / display of them
- `Webdevelopment`: taught the fundamentals of the web (`REST` & `API's`), the goals (like rdf, and control of you own data)
  - but also frameworks like Express React and Vue
- Software Engineering Lab I: taught us Kotlin and android development
  - we made an entire app called [RecipEase](project_descriptions/recipease.md)
