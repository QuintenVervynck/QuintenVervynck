### `2019`
graduated secondary / high school & started at Ghent University (Computer Science)`
The first courses I had were:
- Discrete Mathematics
- to Reason to Abstract and to Formulate (in dutch: redeneren, abstraheren en formuleren, this was simular to mathematical logics
- Programming, this was in Java
- Computerusage, this was about Linux usage and bash scripting
- Databases

### `2020`
Then came the second semester, in which I had the following courses:\
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Algorithms and Datastructures I
- Object Ori√´nted Programming: this course taught the object-ori√´nted programming style, in Java; In this course we had to make a music application named [Accentor](project_descriptions/accentor.md)
- Scripting Languages: this course taught me Python and Javascript

After a long summer vacation, started the first semester of the second year of my bachelor:
- Statistics and Probability
- System Programming: a course about C and C++; in this course we made a 3D version of the video game Supaplex, it was called [Sysplex](project_descriptions/sysplex.md) 
- Communication Networks: a course about networking
- Functional Programming: this course taught the functional programming style in Haskell
- Algorithms and Datastructures II: In this course we made an AI for a 3D version of the game Yavalath, it was called [Yavalath++](project_descriptions/yavalath.md)

### `2021`
And of course after a first semester came a second semester:
- Computer Architecture: about the architecture of a computer (things like how does a cpu work, how does ram-memory work,...)
- Scientific Mathematics: how to calculate things in a pc, taking into account the architecture of the computer
- Multimedia: about imaging, video and sound and of course the compression / storage / display of them
- Webdevelopment: taught the fundamentals of the web (REST & API's), the goals (like rdf, and control of you own data) but also frameworks like React and Vue
- Software Engineering Lab I: taught us Kotlin and android development, we made an entire app called [RecipEase](project_descriptions/recipease.md)
