# Codenames
For this project we had to implement the famous game Codenames ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game))).

The backend needed to be able to handle multiple instances of the game on a local network at once. This backend of the game was implemented with python, and answered calls with json-data.

The frontend was made with Javascript and Bootstrap, no other frameworks as the "looks" of the game didn't really matter for this assignment.
