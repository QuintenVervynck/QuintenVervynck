# Dodona HTML and CSS judge

Dodona is a free online platform created by Ghent University
to teach students how to code. 
We wrote a judge to automatically evaluate HTML & CSS exercises, 
and give students feedback on their submissions.
The judge comes with a custom testing framework,
allowing teachers to write sophisticated exercises
that can still be evaluated fully automatically.
